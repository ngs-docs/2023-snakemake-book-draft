# Beyond Your First Snakefile

This section is intended for people who have already used snakemake,
and now want to learn about and apply some more snakemake features!

A partial list:
* params
* glob_wildcards
* loading from CSVs or elsewhere
* config files

Write something nice about information overload for the intro.

Reorder things so that wildcards are first? Or maybe even their own
section?
