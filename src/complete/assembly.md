# Assembly and evaluating a bacterial genome

In this chapter, we provide a short (but complete!) assembly and evaluation
workflow for a bacterial genome. This workflow takes paired-end Illumina
reads and then:

* runs the megahit assembler on them
* generates a quast report on the assembled genome;
* annotates the assembled genome with prokka;

## Exercises
