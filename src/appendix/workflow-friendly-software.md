# Writing software that is workflow-friendly

## Support error codes properly

## Support command line options

## Support `-o/--output` and/or `--output-directory`

## Support command-line configurability

i.e. don't require config files, or if you do, allow override via command
line.

## Use stdout and stderr consistently

## Don't have side effects outside the directory etc

operate entirely within directories specified

## something about caching/caches?

## use semantic versioning and/or clearly guide people

## make it conda installable :)

## ??
