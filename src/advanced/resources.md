# Resources, constraints, and job management

## Points to make / outline

* impossibility of predicting exactly; a strategy
* how to measure with benchmarks, slurm, top (??); RSS as key thing to manage
* CPU utilization, context switching, overhead; threads, processes
* considerations for parallelism (perhaps also see [parallel](parallel.md)).

Standard resources: mem, disk, runtime, and tmpdir

Your own defined resources: other things.

## Examples

* set up various memory constrained jobs and run with various
  different max memories; show overlap; make figure showing total memory used.
