# String formatting "minilanguage"

The ~5 things you need to know;
Q: how does this intersect with `expand`?

Maybe should add stuff about interacting in/with python?
* f strings vs templates in snakemake
* string "constants" etc

https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec

* quoting
* using quotes in string templates for keys (or, like, not doing that)
* operations
* escaping `{` and `}`
