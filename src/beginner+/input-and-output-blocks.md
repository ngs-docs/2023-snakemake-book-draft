# input: and output: blocks

- comma separated list + keywords
- evaluate to space separated list
- wildcards can be used, no wildcards. prefix required
- quoting with :q

- lists
- names / namespaces

- just the basics, also have advanced section

recommendation:
- don't use list indices - either use {input} or {input.name}
